# Mai Dotfiles

Dotfiles are meant to be shared, so here you are. These are my dotfiles and
instructions to set up my computers.

Target: Ubuntu & Mac

## Prerequisites

Yes, it's ironic that this depends on `git` being installed first :P

```shell
git clone https://github.com/thanhhaimai/dotfiles
```

Or download the ZIP here <https://github.com/thanhhaimai/dotfiles/archive/refs/heads/master.zip>

## Mac Installation

- Install `brew` manually: <https://brew.sh/>
- The reset can be installed via:

```shell
./mac/setup.sh
```

## Ubuntu Installation

- Install `brew` manually: <https://brew.sh/>
- The reset can be installed via:
