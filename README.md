# Mai Dotfiles #

Dotfiles are meant to be shared, so here you are. These are my dotfiles and
instructions to set up my computers. This set of dotfiles haven't been updated
(publicly) for a long time. So let's make that happen :).

Target: Ubuntu 22.04

## Installation

Yes, it's ironic that this depends on git being installed first :P
```
git clone https://github.com/thanhhaimai/dotfiles
```

Or download the ZIP here https://github.com/thanhhaimai/dotfiles/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

Then run:
```
./setup.sh
```

Note: `setup_ssh` and `setup_i3` are disabled by default
